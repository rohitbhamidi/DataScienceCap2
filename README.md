# Problem Statement
The Indian Premier League (IPL) has become a global cricket phenomenon since its inception in 2008, driving growth in player salaries. This project will develop a Machine Learning model to predict the player salary based on statistical aggregate features. In doing so, I will develop a framework for the IPL franchises to make more informed decisions during player auctions on the expected salary of the players.

# Approach
The data for this project was sourced from two distinct repositories. Firstly, ball-by-ball match data spanning the years 2008 to 2021 was acquired from the dataset hosted on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vora1011/ipl-2008-to-2021-all-match-dataset). Secondly, salary information of players was extracted from the online resource available at http://www.cricmetric.com/ipl/salary/.
